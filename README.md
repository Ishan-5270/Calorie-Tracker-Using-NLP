# Calorie-Tracker-Using-NLP
This is a special project because it is something that I use regularly in my day-to-day life. I have tried hard to monitor my workouts and keep track of my calories but often times I struggle organizing things. This application makes use of 
Nutritionix's NLP model converts plain English text to tables on google sheets that keep a record of the time of the exercise, duration, and the number of calories burnt. The NLP model works like a charm but I hope to create my own model - something that is more catered to my own specifications eventually. If you would like to try out this application feel free to make a free account with Nutritionix and Sheety and put your own credentials after forking your own local copy!
